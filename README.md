# Power Forecasting in a Windmill



The world is changing towards renewable energy sources such as wind energy, waterpower, and solar energy. They do not emit greenhouse gases, so they will not increase the risk of the greenhouse effect. Renewable energy has become the mainstream preferred energy solution. 

A customer has set up a renewable energy farm which has several sensors ranging from capturing winds in the turbines to converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. For that, he would like a forecast for the next 7 days of the average power that a wind turbine can generate, in order to know if it will meet its weekly production target. 

### Why make a power forecast?
The customer need to know the impact of the generation on the power grid and also  he needs to know if the amount of energy generated will be enough for his consumption. 

### Solution Format
- Energy Forecasting for the next 7 days.

- Prediction problem (Time Series)

### Data Source:

### Action Plan:

- Comprehension of the technology and statistical analysis of the sensors;
- Exploratory Analysis through the dataset, in order to find some problems and insights
- Data preparation for Machine Learning models
- Evaluation of the error
- Deployment using Database and Metabase as visualization tool
